# Evaluate a new Git server to replacement U.S. GitHub.com.

According: [GitHub and Export Controls](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-and-export-controls)

> GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Server, and the information you upload to either product may be subject to US export control laws, including U.S. Export Administration Regulations (the EAR).

> Although we've provided the following information below for your convenience, it is ultimately your responsibility to ensure that your use of GitHub's products and services complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including US export control laws.

Its means GitHub was controllable by U.S. goverment.

I (Phodal) as a Developer, will need a new Git Server for Free Software.

If you have some advice, please leave in issues or comments.
